# Surplus Market

## Overview

Surplus Market is a space for companies to conduct business to business transactions. They are able to purchase and sell their overstocked inventory. For example, if Chase bank over purchases new computers for a site, Cleveland Clinic could purchase Chases overstocked computers for a new lab on campus and so forth. This is valuable because overall companies can save money year to year and build relationships through our site.

This site will allow users to create a profile of their company which holds generic information (contact, Company name, etc.). This profile will also include (rating, number of items sold, how long they have been a member). They will be able to purchase and add new items to their profile. Our Marketplace will allow users to see ( all available items, all companies, and most popular items).
