# Surplus Market

## Overview

Surplus Market is a space for companies to conduct business to business transactions. They are able to purchase and sell there overstocked inventory. Ex. If Chase bank over purchases new computers for a site, Cleveland Clinic could purchase Chases overstocked computers for a new lab on campus and so forth. This is valuable because in a whole they save money year to year. They are also able to build relationships through our site.

This site will allow users to create a profile of their company which holds generic information (contact, Company name, etc.). This profile will also include (rating, number of items sold, how long they have been a member). They will be able to purchase and add new items to their profile. Our Marketplace will allow users to see ( all available items, all companies, and most popular items).
